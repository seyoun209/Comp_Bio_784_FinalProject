## Research Participants

The methylation array pre-processed beta value was available via the GDC
data portal (Data release 35.0)[1], and RSEM gene expression and
clinical patient data were available from cBioPortal.[2]

We reviewed the clinical and genetic tumor data of 412 patients with
bladder urothelial cancer obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
We subset the patients with missing tumor status (
Tumor-free,with-Tumor, n= 372) and selected only patients when RSEM gene
expression was available. Finally, of the 412 patients, 368 patients
were enrolled in the study.

## DNA methylation data pre-processing

Bladder cancer recurrence was defined based on the tumor status
previously described by Shen et al.[3] In this study, we classified the
recurrence status based on the neoplasm tumor status column in the
patient data. The term "With Tumor" represents the persistence of the
tumor, but not a new tumor event, and is classified as disease
recurrence. The "Tumor Free" status was classified as having no disease
recurrence. It is important to note that "tumor-free" does not mean
"normal" because the "normal" case insists that the tumor never occurred
in the past and/or present. Furthermore, "tumor-free" specifies that the
tumor cannot be measured and that there is still a chance of recurrence.

The given methylation level was quantified and calculated as
$\beta=\frac{\mu}{(M+U+\alpha)}$ where M and U denote the methylated and
unmethylated signals and $\alpha$ represent an offset value. The given
gene expression level was quantified by TPM and normalized using the
RSEM R package, such that
$TPM_{i}=\frac{q_{i}/l_{i}}{\sum_{j}(q_{i}/l_{i})} * 10^{6}$ where
$q_{i}$ denotes reads mapped to transcripts, $l_{i}$ is the transcript
length. The gene expression level was mapped to the hg19 genome and
generated RSEM gene expression data. The promoter region was defined as
1500bp upstream and 500bp downstream from the transcription start site.
A total of 21,010 genes (164,113 methylation probes) were tested.

## Differential methylation analysis

### Linear model

In order to assess the association of tumor status with methylation values, we fit the following linear model for each gene $j=1,\dots,J$:
$$ Y_{ij} = \alpha_j + \beta_j X_{i} + \sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_{jk} Z_i + \epsilon_{ij} $$ where $i$ indexes patients, $Y_{ij}$ indexes methylation values, $X_i$ is an indicator for being “with tumor,” $Z_i$ is a vector of patient level covariates, and $\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. The patient level covariates included in the analysis were age and sex. The $J$ models were fit using empirical Bayes to allow for information sharing across genes. The R package `limma` was used to perform this analysis. The parameters of interest that give the association of tumor status with methylation were $\beta_j, j=1,\dots,J$. 

Since the goal was to identify genes with differential methylation by tumor status, hypothesis tests were performed to select genes with significant $\beta_j$ coefficients for the null hypothesis $\beta_j = 0$ against the alternative $\beta_j \neq 0$ for each gene $j$. The significance level was selected to be $\alpha=0.2$ and the Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons and control the false discovery rate. 


### Bumphunter analysis-Differential methylation region

We used the averaged methylation value of all CpGs within the promoter
region of a gene to identify differential methylation between the tumor
existence in bladder cancer. Using the bumphunter function adapted from
the minfi R package, we obtained differential methylation regions
(DMRs). The Bumphunter function searches for DMRs by looking for GpGs
with mean differences.[4] The statistical model follows:
$Y\_{ij}=\beta_{0}(l_{j}) +\beta_{1}(l_{j})X\_{j}+\varepsilon_{ij}$ The $i$ denotes the subject, $l_{j}$ represents the jth location, $X_{j}$ is the covariate of interest, $\varepsilon_{ij}$ denotes error, $\beta*{0}$ denotes for baseline function and $\beta_{1}(l)$ is the parameter of interest. There are three steps: 1) creating clusters by t-statistical at each genomic location and a phenotype of interest, 2) breaking into segments by candidate region to be a cluster of probes, 3) Test for the significance of the candidate region.  In this study, we used the covariates age and sec and the p-value adjusted FDR was below 0.05, and a change in methylation greater than 10% ($\Delta\beta > 0.1$) was used to identify a significant bump differential methylation region.

## Functional enrichment and network analysis

Functional enrichment analysis using ConsensusPathDb (Release35, CPDB:http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/CPDB)[5] was used to interpret the functional role of a gene identified with differential methylation status. Both significant pathway and gene ontology (GO) terms were defined as having an adjusted p-value( <= 0.05). We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the significant methylated genes by string DB (Version 11.5).[6] We selected the interaction relationship between genes with the highest confidence > 0.9. Pathway and GO term visualized ggplot2 in R package (version 3.4.0).


# Results

## Overview of the study cohort

## Differential DNA methylation analysis in the two subgroups

### Linear model

Out of the 20,118 genes, 12835 were identified to have differential methylation by tumor status. Most genes (124) had a negative coefficient indicating hypomethylation. Figure [] shows a volcano plot of the unadjusted p-values against estimated $\beta$ values, colored by significance. 

The 12835 identified genes were further subsetted to the genes that were also in the gene expression data. For the resulting 113 genes, Figure [] shows the average gene expression (log transformed), against estimated differential methylation values. There was a positive correlation (0.4), suggesting that at the gene level, larger differences in methylation are correlated with higher gene expression.

### Bumphunter

A subset of 164,113 CpG methylation sites out of a total of 485,577 CpG sites was mapped to specific promoters( 21,010 genes) for analysis. Differential methylation region was examined in the individual with a history of recurrence of tumor existence. The age and sex defined our study phenotype of interest. The 15 significant differential methylated regions were identified. With this region, there were predominately hypomethylated (n=13) in "With-Tumor" when compared to "Tumor-free."  This result corresponds to our limma significant differential methylation genes, and MOORE et al.[7]study, which showed global methylation in DNA from blood cells and leukocyte DNA hypomethylation was strongly associated with increased bladder cancer risk. In the DMR region, Fifteen genes were identified, and fourteen were protein-coding genes. Eleven genes were strongly related to bladder cancer.  Nine genes overlap with the limma result.

## Functional enrichment analysis and network

Overrepresentation analysis of the combined set of both tools(limma and bumphunter), we identified 134 significant genes using ConsensusPathDB and revealed eight critical pathways ( q-value < 0.1). (Figure 3) This includes multiple vascular formation-related pathways:  Myogenesis, CDC42 signaling events, Apoptotic cleavage of cell adhesion protein, and VEGFA-VEGFR2. Within the set of 134 differentially methylated genes, 10 Gene Ontology (GO) pathways were significantly over-represented (q-value < 0.05), including "G-protein-coupled serotonin receptor activity" (GO:0004993), "serotonin receptor activity" (GO:0099589)," Thiamine metabolic process" (GO:0006772), and "protein-containing complex scaffold activity" (GO:0032947) Figure x. The protein-protein interaction PPI) network constructed with the STRING database identified five genes with direct interaction (Figure 4). Four out of five genes are functionally grouped into the "Signaling by VEGF" pathway" (R-HSA-194138). The vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) pathway is highly associated with cancer that involves vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Especially the most recent study reported that VEGF expression is associated with tumor grade and muscle-invasiveness of urinary bladder carcinoma when they evaluated immunohistochemical.[8]

## Case study

As described above, our differential methylated genes were enriched in pathways related to VEGF signaling. As a case study, we selected a gene for functional analysis, CDH5. CDH5 gene is known to play a role as cadherin and promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion.[9] CDH5 is not yet studied deeply in bladder cancer, but this gene is a well-known biomarker in breast cancer cells, stimulates TGF-B signaling, and is associated with urinary exosomes.[10] In this study, we identified CDH5 as hypomethylated compared to the tumor-free group, and gene expression statistically increased.

# Discussion

This study used several different methods to identify genes where patients with and without a bladder cancer tumor have differential levels of methylation. However, these results did not necessarily agree with each other or with the existing literature. The analysis using gene-level linear models identified 128135 genes, whereas the analysis using the `bumphunter` R package identified 15 regions where most showed hypomethylation. A functional enrichment analysis found…  The existing literature, however, identified gene promoter regions with hypermethylation26-28.

There are several limitations to this study. First, the definitions of tumor status were coarse and may not adequately capture the biological constructs of interest. As noted earlier, tumor-free status describes a point in time; patients that are currently tumor-free may have a recurrence later. A time-to-event analysis that follows patients for a period of time and measures the durations of tumor and tumor-free status may be beneficial. Additionally, due to a lack of data availability, we did not consider cancer stage or treatment, which may affect the association of methylation and tumor status.

Lack of gene expression data at the transcript level was another limitation. In this study, transcript promoters were defined to be 1500bp upstream from the TSS and 500bp downstream of each transcript promoter region. However, defining promoters in this way may be inadequate since there are many isoforms and the promoter can change locations.

This study was inherently exploratory since associations were examined. It is unclear how these results would generalize to other populations or if the association of methylation and tumor status is confounded by some variable not included in the analysis.

Future work may use richer datasets and different analyses to address the above limitations.
